# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- Speaking with the user and asking the right questions is the most important part of creating the user stories. If you are doing the user story correctly then you should have no trouble creating a program to the specification of the client/user

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- I always code feature by feature that way there is always a finished product that runs with no issues.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- A good team member is open to communication and is not afraid to ask questions or answer questions as they come up. Working together is one of the most important parts of being in any team.
